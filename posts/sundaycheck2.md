## Sunday Requirements
    - Your checkin site should be updated with a heading for week 2
  -   Week 2 should have any updates of what you worked on, where you are in the project, visuals created, etc. It should end with questions and next steps
  -  Your repo that you are working in should start to have some code. Front end people should start working on front end assets. Backend people should start working on some endpoints. API people should be making user-flow diagrams that indicate what users of the solution do, how the front end works with this input, what the backend returns, how the front end then uses this to inform the user.
   -     You should have at least 2 of these user flows attempted. In the end you'll need every process loop documented of the user + frontend + backend and how they play together
  -  Any data structures you need for backend and frontend should at least start being documented / generated. This will change over time potentially but you need some aggreed upon early work to get started at least. This would look like (hypothetically, this is not THE answer here this was like 2 min of thinking about it on my part): getNewWord.js
